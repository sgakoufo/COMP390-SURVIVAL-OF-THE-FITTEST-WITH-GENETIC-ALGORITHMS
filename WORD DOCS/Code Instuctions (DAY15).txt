FOR CARGENERATOR:
High frequencey so wheels dont bounce
Vector2 movement = new Vector(1,0); so that the car constantly moves forward.
We can have this fixed or not, depending on our environment!

How to create a car:

-Create an empty object called creature
-CarBody
	-2D Object Sprite Square(Gives Sprite Renderer)
	-Box Collider(Dont change)
	-RigidBody2d(Dont change)
	-The Script for moving
		-Either set the Vector2D object to listen
		to user input, or pre-set it to 1 for x axis.
		-THE SCRIPT HAS TO BE IN THE ASSETS FOLDER
		
-Wheel:
	-Transform: Put the wheel where you want it.
	-2d Object Sprite Circle(Gives Sprite Renderer
	-Circle Collider 2d(Dont change)
	-RigidBody2d(Dont change)
	-WheelJoin2D
		-Connect the Rigid Body to CarBody
		-Set Suspension to 20 for no hippy hop

		-Anchor 0 0
		-Connected Anchor: Connect where you want it.
		
			- to change suspension on script:
			JointSuspension2D suspension = frontWheelJoint.suspension;
        		suspension.frequency = 20.0f;
        		frontWheelJoint.suspension = suspension;


GENETIC ALGORITHMS:
	-Speed
	-Wheel Size aka:(Transform scale, x and y)
	-Wheel position( Transform + anchor. Need to set limits.
			They are not exactly the same values, and
			if the anchor is set to be outside the body 
			the simulation goes apeshit)


FOR SIMULATION:
For the camera, make sure to assign the MainCamera gameobject to the public variable
in the script. (Check day15 Dev Updated doc)
